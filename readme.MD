# NGUInjector

NGUInjector is an automation platform for the steam version of NGU Idle.

# Instructions

Releases can be found in the releases section of the github page [here](https://github.com/rvazarkar/NGUInjector/releases). The latest release can be found [here](https://github.com/rvazarkar/NGUInjector/releases/latest). Do not download the source code archive, instead download the zip file with the release version in the name (3.0.0.zip for example). Extract the downloaded archive to a directory of your choice. To start automation, run inject.bat in the extracted folder when NGU Idle is open. DO NOT RUN AS ADMINISTRATOR.

You'll know the injection has worked if you see the following in the upper left portion of NGU.

![Injected](https://i.imgur.com/JIF2pl4.png)

To upgrade to a new release, unload the injector from the General Settings page and then inject the new version.

# Configuration

After injecting the dll, a new folder will be created on your Desktop called NGUInjector. Settings files will be automatically written to this directory. The following files are of interest:

- **settings.json** - Contains settings used by the application. Most settings can be configured from the in-game menu.
- **zoneOverrides.json** - Override the default values for Idle/Manual Power/Toughness for gold sniping

A profiles folder will be created with the following files:

- **default.json** - Breakpoints for assigning gear, magic, energy, wandoos OS, rebirth time, and diggers. See the allocation section for more information

More profiles can be added to this folder at your discretion.

A logs folder will also be created with the following files:

- **loot.log** - Logs all the loot dropped by enemies.
- **inject.log** - Logs general information about the injector
- **combat.log** - Logs information from the combat algorithm
- **allocation.log** - Logs information about allocating energy/magic/gear/diggers
- **pitspin.log** - Logs important things like fruit harvests, money pit, daily spin. This log file will not be overwritten.

Saving either file will automatically reload the settings in the configuration file. Reloading the game isn't necessary

# Allocation

Allocation profiles can be found in the profiles folder and contain time breakpoints for configuring your gear, diggers, energy allocation and magic allocation. Sample allocation files can be found in the sampleprofile folder.

[Sample 24 Hour Profile](https://github.com/rvazarkar/NGUInjector/blob/master/NGUInjector/SampleProfiles/24hr_with_gear.json).

The time portion of every breakpoint refers to rebirth time in seconds. Time can be defined as a simple number (ex: 86400) or as a JSON object:

```
"Time": {
    "h": 1,
    "m": 30,
    "s": 20
},
```

Priorities can be modified with an optional percentage cap by adding a : and a percent. As an example:

```
CAPWISH-0:30
```

This will cap wish 0 but limit the maximum amount allocated to 30% of your current cap. When applied to non-cap priorities, it will limit to % of idle resource. Priorities will respect targets and not allocate to priorities that are target capped.

## Energy

An energy breakpoint is structured as follows:

```
"Energy": [
    {
        "Time": 0,
        "Priorities": ["CAPNGU-0", "CAPWAN", "AT-1", "NGU-1"]
    }
]

```

Priorities come in 2 types - cap and non-cap. Any priority that has -X after it is 0 indexed.

A cap priority will use as much idle energy as possible and hit the highest BB breakpoint possible for the next 10 seconds. A non-cap priority will take a divider of your idle energy based on number of non-cap priorities and attempt to hit the highest BB breakpoint possible for the next 10 seconds. When a priority is calculated, it will push excess energy to later priorities.

In the above example the following actions will be taken:

- NGU-0 (NGU Augments) will be capped
- Wandoos energy will be capped
- Remaining energy will be split between AT-1 (Advanced Training Power) and NGU-1 (NGU Wandoos)

Available cap priorities for Energy are as follows:

- CAPNGU-X (0-8) - Calculate a cap for the NGU
- CAPALLNGU - Calculate a cap for every NGU starting from 0
- CAPAT-X (0-4) - Calculate a cap for the AT and attempt to BB it.
- CAPALLAT - Calculate caps for all ATs and BB them.
- CAPBESTAUG - Attempts to allocate to the best augment possible. Before pairs are unlocked, will allocate to highest augment that is easily doable. After will try to optimize.
- CAPWAN - Calculate a cap for wandoos energy
- CAPTM - Calculate a cap for energy time machine and attempt to BB it.
- CAPBT-X (0-11) - Calculate a cap for basic training
- CAPALLBT - Caps all basic trainings
- CAPAUG-X (0-13) - Calculate a cap for augments and attempt to BB it
- CAPWISH-X (0-X) - Allocate energy to wishes. X is the wish slot you wish to allocate to. If you only have 1 slot, WISH-0 will be the one you use. Wishes will follow the priority set in the WishPriorities setting and then work through cheapest wishes

Available non-cap priorities for Energy are as follows:

- ALLNGU - Allocate energy to every NGU
- NGU-X (0-8) - Allocate energy to NGU
- AT-X (0-4) - Allocate energy to AT
- ALLAT - Allocate energy to all AT
- AUG-X (0-13) - Allocate energy to augment
- BESTAUG - Attempts to allocate to the best augment possible. Before pairs are unlocked, will allocate to highest augment that is easily doable. After will try to optimize.
- WAN - Allocate energy to energy wandoos
- TM - Allocate energy to energy time machine
- BT-X (0-11) - Allocate energy to basic training
- WISH-X (0-X) - Allocate energy to wishes. X is the wish slot you wish to allocate to. If you only have 1 slot, WISH-0 will be the one you use. Wishes will follow the priority set in the WishPriorities setting and then work through cheapest wishes

More information on allocation indexes can be found on the [wiki](https://github.com/rvazarkar/NGUInjector/wiki/Allocation-Indexes)

## Magic

A magic breakpoint is structured as follows:

```
"Magic": [
    {
        "Time": 0,
        "Priorities": ["CAPNGU-0", "CAPWAN", "BR", "NGU-1"]
    }
]

```

Priorities come in 2 types - cap and non-cap. Any priority that has -X after it is 0 indexed.

A cap priority will use as much idle energy as possible and hit the highest BB breakpoint possible for the next 10 seconds. A non-cap priority will take a divider of your idle energy based on number of non-cap priorities and attempt to hit the highest BB breakpoint possible for the next 10 seconds. When a priority is calculated, it will push excess energy to later priorities.

In the above example the following actions will be taken:

- NGU-0 (NGU Yggdrasil) will be capped
- Wandoos magic will be capped
- Magic rituals will be capped from highest to lowest, with rituals taking more than 1 hour skipped
- Remaining magic will be allocated to NGU-1 (NGU Exp)

Available cap priorities for Magic are as follows:

- CAPNGU-X (0-6) - Use the cap button for the NGU
- CAPALLNGU - Use the cap button for every NGU starting from 0
- CAPWAN - Use the cap button for wandoos magic
- CAPTM - Calculate a cap for magic time machine and attempt to BB it.
- CAPRIT-X - Calculate a cap for the ritual and allocate
- CAPWISH-X (0-X) - Allocate magic to wishes. X is the wish slot you wish to allocate to. If you only have 1 slot, WISH-0 will be the one you use. Wishes will follow the priority set in the WishPriorities setting and then work through cheapest wishes
- BR - Cast rituals from highest to lowest ignoring rituals you cant afford or will take more than an hour
- BR-X - Cast rituals from highest to lowest that will finish before time specified by X. BR-3600 will cast rituals that will end before the 1 hour mark from your current time.

Available non-cap priorities for Magic are as follows:

- NGU-X (0-6) - Allocate energy to NGU
- WAN - Allocate energy to magic wandoos
- TM - Allocate energy to magic time machine
- RIT-X - Allocate energy to ritual
- WISH-X (0-X) - Allocate magic to wishes. X is the wish slot you wish to allocate to. If you only have 1 slot, WISH-0 will be the one you use. Wishes will follow the priority set in the WishPriorities setting and then work through cheapest wishes

More information on allocation indexes can be found on the [wiki](https://github.com/rvazarkar/NGUInjector/wiki/Allocation-Indexes)

## R3

An R3 breakpoint is structured as follows:

```
"R3": [
    {
        "Time": 0,
        "Priorities": ["HACK-1"]
    }
]

```

Available priorities for R3 are as follows:

- (CAP)HACK-X (0-14) - Allocate R3 to hacks. Will only ever allocate to the first hack in your priority list that hasn't met its target.
- (CAP)ALLHACK - Adds every hack from 0 to 14 as a priority
- (CAP)WISH-X (0-X) - Allocate R3 to wishes. X is the wish slot you wish to allocate to. If you only have 1 slot, WISH-0 will be the one you use. Wishes will follow the priority set in the WishPriorities setting and then work through cheapest wishes

## Gear

A gear breakpoint is structured as follows:

```
"Gear": [
    {
        "Time": 0,
        "ID": [189, 442, 160, 441, 148, 169, 139, 184, 187, 185, 186, 188]
    }
]

```

The list of IDs is the IDs of the gear desired.

You can dump your loadouts from Gear Optimizer using the method found on [this wiki page](https://github.com/rvazarkar/NGUInjector/wiki/Dump-Equipment-from-GO)

## Diggers

A digger breakpoint is structured as follows:

```
"Diggers": [
    {
        "Time": 3650,
        "List": [3, 4, 5, 8]
    }
]

```

The list of diggers is 0 indexed. Drop chance digger is 0, EXP digger is 11. More information can be found on the [wiki](https://github.com/rvazarkar/NGUInjector/wiki/Allocation-Indexes)

## Wandoos

A wandoos breakpoint is structured as follows:

```
"Wandoos": [
    {
        "Time": 0,
        "OS": 1
    }
]

```

The OS is 0 indexed. Wandoos 98 is 0, Wandoos MEH is 1, Wandoos XL is 2

## NGU Difficulty

A NGU Difficulty breakpoint is structured as follows:

```
"NGUDiff": [
    {
    "Time": 0,
    "Diff": 0
    }
]
```

The difficulty is 0 indexed. Normal NGUs is 0, Evil NGUs is 1, Sadistic NGUs is 2

## Rebirth

Rebirth Breakpoints can be written 2 ways. A simple time based breakpoint is written as follows:

```
"RebirthTime": -1
```

A setting of -1 means no rebirths. Otherwise rebirth will be performed when the time in seconds is reached.

More complex rebirth breakpoints can be done as follows:

```
"Rebirth": {
    "Type": "Time",
    "Target": {
    "h": 24,
    "m": 1
    },
    "Challenges": []
},
```

The following types are available:

- **Time** - Rebirths when a certain time passes
- **Number** - Rebirths when your number will be OldNumber \* _Target_
- **Bosses** - Rebirths when you can defeat _Target_ additional bosses

The following example will rebirth when your number is 10x your previous number:

```
"Rebirth": {
    "Type": "Number",
    "Target": 10,
    "Challenges": []
},
```

The following example will rebirth when you can kill 5 more bosses than your last rebirth:

```
"Rebirth": {
    "Type": "Bosses",
    "Target": 5,
    "Challenges": []
},
```

Additionally, you may specify challenges to rebirth into. The following string correspond to challenges:

- **BASIC** - Basic
- **NOAUG** - No Augments
- **24HR** - 24 Hour
- **100LC** - 100 Level Challenge
- **NOEC** - No Equipment
- **TC** - Troll Challenge
- **NORB** - No Rebirth
- **LSC** - Laser Sword Challenge
- **BLIND** - Blind Challenge
- **NONGU** - No NGU
- **NOTM** - No Time Machine

Challenges must be given a number afterwards to specify which challenge is being completed. Challenges start at 1. Ex:

```
"Challenges": ["BASIC-1", "BASIC-2", "TC-1","NOEQ-1"]
```

# Zone Stat Overrides

The optimal zone for gold sniping is calculated using a set of values from pins that show stats necessary to do each zone. If the manual threshold is met for a zone, the script will snipe a boss without fast combat. If the idle threshold is met, the script will snipe a boss using fast combat. Beast Mode will always be turned off for this.

The stats for the zones can be manually overriden using the `zoneOverrides.json` file in the user's directory. For the default stats used see [here](https://github.com/rvazarkar/NGUInjector/wiki/Default-Zone-Stats-for-Sniping)

# Other Features

The pitspin.log file will contain the results of each automatic money pit, daily spin, and yggdrasil harvest and will persist across sessions.

## Quick Disable/Enable

Pressing the F2 button will globally disable all features of the app until re-enabled.

## Turn on Autoattack in ITOPOD

Have you forgotten to turn on auto attack before and left yourself AFK in ITOPOD doing nothing? Me too! Pressing the F4 button will toggle the script to automatically turn auto attack on if you're in ITOPOD and its not on.

## Auto Merge Boost to 100
