"comments" : "Your best off using the script close to Titan 1 + or a bit below, you want your basic training caps also to be fairly low, and turn on synch training, as that will help, Been running with the above for a bit, so far it working fine. Blood you don't really use at chat 1 or 2. So I've been using it for blood number boosting. For energy, I capped at 30% in time machine, you don't need a lot there, about 6/7 levels (set in NGU idle) then it will shift the energy for augs. For augs, I find some levels in milk (50 / 100) (or remove CAPAUG-2 if you don't want it boost that. Then the rest will be in safely scissors and 10% in danger scissors. (depending on how much gold your making, this won't go up too many levels. So adding about 10% there is fine, but if you want more, change the 10 to a bigger number."
